# Logging and tracing

This is the target convention. The logger, the redaction list, the OpenTelemetry SDK, its
instrumentations and its exporters belong to `@cadenway/nest-common`: the gateway configures them and
installs no logging or telemetry library of its own. `pino-pretty` is the one exception, a
development dependency for readable local output. Check what the installed kit exports before relying
on a name.

## Logs

- JSON lines from the logger of `@cadenway/nest-common`; never `console.log`.
- Fields: `service`, `version`, `traceId`, `spanId`, `organizationId`, `userId`, `route`, `status`,
  `durationMs`. `organizationId` and `userId` come from the verified handshake, never from a client
  message.
- Redaction: tokens, passwords and e-mail addresses are masked by the list of the kit. No e-mail
  address and no IP address at `info` level.
- The handshake ticket (`auth.token`) and message payloads never reach a log line.
- `LOG_LEVEL` sets the level; it is validated at start-up and described in `.env.example`.

## Traces

- W3C Trace Context: the `traceparent` of a consumed event is continued, and every HTTP call the
  gateway makes carries it.
- SQL values and query strings are excluded from spans.
- Spans come from the instrumentations of the kit (HTTP, Express, ioredis, undici) and its own NestJS
  interceptor. `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-nestjs-core` and `-router` stay out: the first does not
  support NestJS 12, the second doubles the spans under Express 5.

## Start-up (ESM)

The telemetry must be loaded before the application imports Express:

```text
node --experimental-loader=@opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs --import ./telemetry.js dist/main.js
```

- This is the only documented way while NestJS 12 imports Express as ESM. Node 24 marks
  `--experimental-loader` as discouraged: revisit the command with each Node or SDK upgrade.
- The flags go on the `node` start command (the `CMD` of the `Dockerfile`), not in application code.
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` points to the collector; like `LOG_LEVEL`, it is validated at start-up
  and described in `.env.example`.

## Metrics

- Throughput, errors and duration per route, and the lag of each event consumer. The label is the
  route pattern or the consumer name, never a room, an id or a token.
- Exported over OTLP to the collector; no `prom-client`.
- The gateway has no outbox and no database pool: those metrics belong to the services.
